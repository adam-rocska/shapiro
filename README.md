Model data as knowledge graphs using the JSON-LD syntax, use these models in API definitions/implementations and all code consuming data following these models such that the same machine-readable model definitions are pervasive throughout all phases of the software lifecycle (design, implement, test, release) and the data lifecycle (model, originate, distribute/use, archive/delete).

Start out with providing a toolset from developers for developers, gradually extending towards tools, editors, UIs making this modelling approach accessible to non-technnical actors.
