Model data as knowledge graphs using the JSON-LD syntax and use these models in API definitions/implementations and all other code consuming data based on these models.

Make the use of these machine-readable model definitions pervasive throughout all phases of the software lifecycle (design, implement, test, release) and the lifecycle of the data originating from software built using these models.

Express non-functional requirements like security, traceability/lineage, data quality in the models and bind them to the instances of data wherever the data is distributed to and used.

Drive all documentation (model diagrams, documents, graph visualizations, etc.) from the same JSON-LD model definition (a.k.a. ontology/knowledge graph).

Start out with providing a toolset from developers for developers for formulating such models and using them in source code, gradually extending towards tools, editors, UIs, transformations making this modelling approach accessible to non-technnical actors like business analysts, domain data owners, etc.
